# Data-Professionals-Survey (plus Interactive Dashboard made with PowerBI

## Description
This project uses real 2024 survey data from data professionals, sourced via GitHub. I used Power BI to practice data transformation and visualization, creating an interactive dashboard to explore industry trends in roles, tools, education, and compensation.

## Project Objectives 
- <a href="">Raw Dataset</a>
- Explore the demographics, compensation, tools used, and career satisfaction of data professionals
- Visualize relationships across roles, locations, and experience levels
- Identify patterns based on salary, job title, country, and education

## Initial Questions
- Which job roles are most common in the data industry?
- How does compensation vary by job title?
- What tools are most frequently used by data professionals?
- How satisfied are data professionals with their salary and work-life balance?

## My Process
- Loaded raw survey data from Excel into Power BI and performed data transformations using Power Query (e.g., removed nulls, standardized values, created delimiters, etc.)
- Created visuals to show trends in age, location, role, salary, tools, and satisfaction ratings
- Focused on a clean, minimal layout for clarity and usability of the interactive dashboard
